##Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

##Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Used a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

##Data Engineering
Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

##Data Analysis
*List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
*List employees who were hired in 1986.
*List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
*List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
*List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

##SQL Alchemy
Import the SQL database into Pandas using the following:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
connection = engine.connect()
*Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
*Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
